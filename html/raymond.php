		<p>Raymond has always believed in the power of a friendly smile and a firm handshake. This mindset, along with unwavering tenacity when faced with seemingly daunting tasks, has been essential in many aspects of his life. Whether he's working on his next tech startup, trying to get his homemade interpreter to properly generate a parse tree, or increase his max bench press at the gym, this philosophy of his remains true. </p>
		<p>Being a hybrid computer scientist and entrepreneur, Raymond is fascinated by the development of elegant solutions that meet the demands of today's tech-savvy market. As such, he founded his first tech startup during sophomore year of high school and has founded and worked for many others since then. At age 14, he took his first college class at El Paso Community College. Today, he has many more advanced classes under his belt, including courses related to algorithmic analysis, high-level programming techniques, data structures, computer systems, and other not-so-techy classes like macroeconomic analysis and ethics.</p>
