		After graduating, Max worked at a college savings company called Ascensus for several months as a client services analyst.  His role mainly involved processing financial transactions of account owners and verifying accuracy.  He later left the company to return to school and pursue computer science.  He is currently working towards a certificate in software engineering from Boston University.

		In the fall of 2014, Max created his first Android app, an ear training game to help people better understand music theory.  The app quizzes
		the player on musical scales and intervals to help develop better understanding of pitch and harmony. The game is intended to be educational
		but also fun.  He is planning to make a second app soon, and has been studying the principles of the Java language to write better 
		and more efficient apps.

		He has been playing guitar for close to 10 years and has studied musical composition in order to write original songs and scores.  During 
		college he was the lead guitarist in several bands, and is seeking to form one in the Boston area as well.
		
		Max began snowboarding freshman year of college during a health and wellness course and has enjoyed it ever since.  Last year he spent a week at the
